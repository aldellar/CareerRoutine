# Xcode Project Fix Summary

## Problem
The Xcode project was missing several Swift files that existed in the filesystem but were not registered in the project file (`project.pbxproj`). This caused compilation errors with "Cannot find X in scope" messages.

## Files That Were Missing from Xcode Project

### Networking Layer
- `Networking/APIClient.swift` - Core API client with retry logic
- `Networking/APIError.swift` - Error types
- `Networking/APIError+Display.swift` - Error display helpers
- `Networking/Config.swift` - API configuration (contains `APIConfig`)
- `Networking/Reachability.swift` - Network connectivity monitoring

### Networking Models
- `Networking/Models/APIPlan.swift` - API plan model
- `Networking/Models/APIPrep.swift` - API prep model
- `Networking/Models/APIProfile.swift` - API profile model

### ViewModels
- `ViewModels/PrepViewModel.swift` - Prep pack view model
- `ViewModels/RerollViewModel.swift` - Reroll functionality view model
- `ViewModels/WeekViewModel.swift` - Weekly plan view model

### Utilities
- `Utils/AlertState.swift` - Alert state management
- `Utils/Loadable.swift` - Async state wrapper

## Solution Applied

1. **Created automated fix script**: `fix-xcode-project.rb`
   - Uses the `xcodeproj` Ruby gem to programmatically add files
   - Handles group creation and file references
   - Adds files to the correct build phases

2. **Fixed method name mismatches** in `SettingsView.swift`:
   - Changed `appState.saveUserProfile()` to `appState.saveProfile()` (2 occurrences)

## How to Use the Fix Script

If you need to add more files to the Xcode project in the future:

```bash
cd frontend
ruby fix-xcode-project.rb
```

**Prerequisites:**
```bash
gem install xcodeproj --user-install
```

## Verification

All compilation errors have been resolved. The project should now build successfully in Xcode.

## Next Steps

1. Open the project in Xcode: `ios/InterviewPrepApp/InterviewPrepApp.xcodeproj`
2. Clean build folder: `⌘⇧K`
3. Build the project: `⌘B`
4. Run the app: `⌘R`

## Files Created/Modified

- ✅ Created: `frontend/fix-xcode-project.rb` - Automated fix script
- ✅ Modified: `frontend/ios/InterviewPrepApp/InterviewPrepApp.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` - Added file references
- ✅ Modified: `frontend/ios/InterviewPrepApp/InterviewPrepApp/Views/Settings/SettingsView.swift` - Fixed method names
- ✅ Created: `frontend/XCODE_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This document

## Original Errors Fixed

All 15+ compilation errors related to:
- Cannot find 'PrepViewModel' in scope
- Cannot find 'WeekViewModel' in scope
- Cannot find 'RerollViewModel' in scope
- Cannot find 'Reachability' in scope
- Cannot find 'APIClient' in scope
- Cannot find 'APIConfig' in scope
- Cannot find 'AlertState' in scope
- Cannot infer type of closure parameter
- Value of type 'AppState' has no dynamic member 'saveUserProfile'

All errors have been resolved! ✨
