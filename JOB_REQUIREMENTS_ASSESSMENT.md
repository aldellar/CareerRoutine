# Job Requirements Assessment: LLM Engineer Role

## Executive Summary

You've built an **interview prep app with LLM-powered features** that demonstrates competency in several key areas. However, there's a **critical mismatch** in the core technical requirement that needs to be addressed.

## üö® CRITICAL GAP: Python vs Node.js

**Job Requirement:** "Strong **Python** plus hands-on prompt/LLM engineering"

**Your Implementation:** Node.js/Express backend

**Impact:** This is the most significant gap. The job explicitly requires Python, and your entire backend is in JavaScript. While your architecture and safety systems are strong, the language mismatch is disqualifying.

**Action Required:**
- Either rewrite the backend in Python (FastAPI or Flask)
- Or create a new Python project demonstrating similar LLM skills

- Can reuse your prompts/schemas/logic

### 2. **Evaluation Loops** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Missing:**
- Unit tests for prompt outputs
- Regression test suite
- Shadow production deployment pattern
- A/B testing infrastructure
- Quality metrics dashboard

**Your current strength:**
- You have logging that COULD support evals
- But no actual eval tests or infrastructure

**What to add:**
- Create a small test suite that validates prompt outputs
- Show how you'd measure "quality" (like task completeness, safety scores)
- Add an eval script that tests multiple scenarios

### 3. **Voice/Text Therapy Context** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**The job is about mental health therapy features**

**Your app is about:** Interview prep (different domain)

**What this means:**
- Your safety systems ARE relevant and transferable
- Your LLM architecture is applicable
- But the domain context is different

**How to address in application:**
- Emphasize transferable safety patterns
- Explain how your guardrails would apply to mental health
- Show you understand GAD-7 (anxiety) measurement
- Demonstrate you can build for sensitive contexts

### 4. **Weekly Shipping Cadence** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Evidence needed:**
- Show iterative improvements
- Commit history showing rapid iteration
- Documentation of decisions and metrics

**Your current state:**
- Comprehensive documentation in `/documentation`
- Well-structured code suggesting good practices
- But no evidence of "weekly" shipping cycles

### 5. **Tool Use / Function Calling** ‚ö†Ô∏è (Basic)
**What you have:**
- JSON schema strict mode (similar to function calling)
- Structured outputs

**What's missing:**
- Explicit function/tool definitions
- Dynamic tool selection
- Tool parameter handling
