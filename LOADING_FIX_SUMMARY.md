# Loading Screen Timing Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 0. **CRITICAL: No Real API Calls Being Made**
**Problem:** The app was using `NetworkService` which only returned mock data. No actual HTTP requests were being sent to the backend API at `http://localhost:8081`.

**Solution:** 
- Updated `NetworkService` to use the existing `APIClient` for real HTTP requests
- Added toggle for mock vs real API mode (`useMockData` flag)
- Integrated proper API model conversions (APIProfile ‚Üî UserProfile, APIPlan ‚Üí Routine, APIPrep ‚Üí PrepPack)
- Added detailed logging to show when real vs mock calls are happening

**See `API_INTEGRATION_FIX.md` for full details on enabling real API calls.**

### 1. Loading Screen Was Too Fast
**Problem:** The mock API calls returned instantly, causing the loading screen to complete in ~2.5 seconds instead of the intended ~19 seconds.

**Solution:** Added realistic 8-second delays to mock mode to simulate actual API response times.

### 2. Progress Not Synced with API Responses
**Problem:** Progress simulation was set for 10 seconds but API calls completed instantly, causing mismatched timing.

**Solution:** Adjusted progress simulation durations in `LoadingCoordinator` to match the 8-second API delays:
- Routine: 0.05 ‚Üí 0.32 over 8 seconds
- Prep Pack: 0.35 ‚Üí 0.65 over 8 seconds  
- Saving: 0.70 ‚Üí 0.98 over 2.5 seconds

### 3. Validation for Both Routine and Prep Pack
**Problem:** No validation to ensure both routine AND prep pack were generated before completion.

**Solution:** Added guard statements in `saveLocally()` to validate both are present. If either is missing, an error is shown to the user.

## New Timeline

The loading screen now follows this timeline (total ~19 seconds):

1. **Step 1: Generate Routine** (~8 seconds)
   - Progress: 5% ‚Üí 33%
   - Status: "Generating your weekly routine‚Ä¶" ‚Üí "Routine created!"

2. **Brief pause** (0.5 seconds)

3. **Step 2: Generate Prep Pack** (~8 seconds)
   - Progress: 35% ‚Üí 66%
   - Status: "Building your prep plan‚Ä¶" ‚Üí "Prep pack ready!"

4. **Brief pause** (0.5 seconds)

5. **Step 3: Save Locally** (~2 seconds)
   - Progress: 70% ‚Üí 100%
   - Status: "Finalizing everything‚Ä¶" ‚Üí "All set!"
   - Validates both routine and prep pack exist
   - Saves to AppState
   - Triggers onboarding completion

## Debug Logging

Added comprehensive logging throughout the process:
- üöÄ Start of loading with user info and timeline
- üîµ API call starts
- ‚úÖ Successful completions
- ‚ùå Errors with details
- üìä Progress updates
- üìù Final validation before completion

## Files Modified

1. **NetworkService.swift**
   - Added 8-second delays to `generateRoutine()` and `generatePrepPack()`

2. **LoadingViewExample.swift** (LoadingCoordinator class)
   - Updated progress simulation timing to match API delays
   - Added validation for both routine and prep pack
   - Enhanced logging throughout the flow
   - Increased save phase duration

## Testing

To test the fix:
1. Complete the onboarding flow
2. On the loading screen, you should see:
   - Smooth progress over ~19 seconds total
   - Three distinct phases matching the step indicators
   - Progress completes only after BOTH routine and prep pack are generated
3. Check the Xcode console for detailed logging of the entire flow

## Notes

- When real API endpoints are connected, remove the `Task.sleep()` delays from NetworkService
- The progress simulation will automatically sync with actual API response times
- All validation and error handling will remain in place
